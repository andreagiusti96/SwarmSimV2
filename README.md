# SwarmSim

Simulate 2D and 3D swarms of mobile agents with various dynamics and implement distributed control laws to obtain different behaviours.

To execute your first simulation simply run Launcher.m.

Features:
  - Simulation of swarms of mobile agents.
  - Implement your own dynamical model or use one of the embedded ones (see integrateAgents.m).
  - Implement your own distributed control law or use one of the embedded ones (see globalInteractionForce.m).
  - Acquisition of metrics to evaluate the performance.
  - Extensive simulations to study stochastic effects or different initial conditions (see MultiLauncher.m).
  - Extensive simulations to study the effects of the parameters (see SequentialLauncher.m).
  - Local stability analysis through linearization (see CrystalStability).
  - Interface with Robotarium code to perform advanced simulations and real life experiments (see RobotariumSimulator). 
    For more details refer to https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu.
  - Plots to visualise the simulation and the metrics.
  - Automatic save the results of the simulations.

This project implements the algorithms described in [Giusti2022] (see [SwarmSimV1](https://github.com/diBernardoGroup/SwarmSimPublic/releases/tag/v1)) and [Giusti2023]. In the Media folder, there is a video supplement for [Giusti2022].
